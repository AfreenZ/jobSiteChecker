/Finding a job or internship during these times is difficult, 
and the listings on popular job finding sites may be fraudulent. 
Many budding students may fall prey to these, so we wanted to 
make a Chrome Extension that alerted users of possible fake job listings./

/Our chrome extension scans a webpage looking for "trigger words".
Some examples of these words are "SSN" or "hired immediately", which 
are often used in scam job listings. After detecting these words,
the extension should alert the user with a message of how many trigger
words were found. This should warn the user that this listing may be a scam./
